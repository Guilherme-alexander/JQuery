### jQuery is provided under the MIT license.

The code is hosted and developed in the jQuery GitHub repository. If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it on the Developing jQuery Core Forum. If you'd like to participate in developing jQuery, peruse our contributor site for more information.

To find and download plugins developed by jQuery contributors, please visit the Plugins site. Plugin authors are responsible for maintenance of their plugins. Feedback on plugins should be directed to the plugin author, not the jQuery team.

### Build from Git

Note: To just use the latest work-in-progress version of jQuery, please try the jQuery Pre-Release Build described above.

All source code is kept under Git revision control, which you can browse online. The repository's README has more information on building and testing your own jQuery, as well as instructions on creating a custom build that excludes some APIs to reduce file size.

If you have access to Git, you can connect to the repository here:


`git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git`                                                                                      
`git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
git checkout 1.2.6`
